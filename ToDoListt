The list is not in priority order

Think of a way to implement the "dummy"
	The dummy is the partner of the contractor
	For the duration of a Deal, the contractor plays his hand (when it is his turn) and the dumy's (when it is the dummy's)
	The dummy's hand is public (everybody can see it)
	
Add double and redouble contracts

Improve the user interface (display and printing)

Maybe have =!= possibilities for ending game (reach a certain amount of points, do a number of deals, play for some time ..

History of all plays
